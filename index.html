        <h2>A litle about myself</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, my name is Vuinishiusu Gonsaruvuesu. I hate a lot of things, and I don't particularly like anything. What I have is not a dream, because I will make it a reality. I'm going to become a Data Analyst, and <s>kill</s> a certain someone.
        </p>
        
        <p> No more anime references, I promisse. But I do want to become a Data Analyst, I have been studying about Data Science for a certain time, and seriously, it fascinates me, the idea of extracting insights from data and putting what was learned through this process to work... it really puts a smile on my face :D. That's what I see myself doing in a few years (maybe even months). </p>
        
        <p> Another area that interest me is web development, especially back-end (I hate CSS). I never had an interest in Web until I found myself studying it at University. The begining was slow and boring, but now that I'm understanding how the beautiful, yet unseen, back-end world works, I'm really liking it, and I wouldn't mind working as a web developer. I'm currently learning Node.js and Java for academic reasons.</p>
        
        <p> I'm doing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, it's helping me to build strong foundations; I hope to finish it by the end of the year. </p>

        <p> Next, I'll dive deep into Excel, SQL and Python to do some side projects on my own. Due to my slower learning pace, I reckon it will require an extended period.</p>

        <p> No worries, life is a marathon :) </p>
